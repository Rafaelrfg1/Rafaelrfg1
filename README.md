## About me: 

I am currently working on earning my associate's degree in Electrical Engineering. I have experience in Java and a little bit of Python also. I am actively working on improving my skills by working on Arduino projects on my own time in C++. Outside of working on my skillset, I enjoy fitness, music, hiking, and cooking. I am actively seeking an internship opportunity to apply what I am learning in the real world and develop my skills further. Below are some links to the programs I have working on in my CS 145 Class. My email is rafaelrfg05@gmail.com and here is my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rafael-figueroa-716357332/). Thank you for your time!
